# Rest-Api-in-ASP.Net-Core
In this repository I want to give a plain starting point at how to build a WebAPI with ASP.NET Core.

## Testing it out
1)Clone this repository<br/>
2)Build the solution using Visual Studio, or on the command line with dotnet build.<br/>
3)Run the project. The API will start up on http://localhost:5000 with dotnet run.<br/>
4)Use an HTTP client like Postman or Fiddler to GET http://localhost:5000.<br/>
