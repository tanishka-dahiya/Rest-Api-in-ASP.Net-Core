# Rest-Api-in-ASP.Net-Core
In this repository I want to give a plain starting point at how to build a WebAPI with ASP.NET Core.

This repository contains a controller which is dealing with Expenses Tracker. You can POST/GET/DELETE a user and also GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/ DELETE a expense.

Hope this helps.
